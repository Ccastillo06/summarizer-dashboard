    author_id: seedAuthors[2].id,
    content: `<div class='article'>
      <p>As Unity adjusts its monetization strategy and Unreal expands its Blueprint system, indie developers are reevaluating their tools of choice. While Unreal offers stunning visuals and performance, Unity still dominates when it comes to flexibility and ease of use for smaller teams.</p>
      <p>With Unity's asset store and strong community support, many indies find the transition between prototyping and production more intuitive. However, Unreal’s recent enhancements in C++ tooling and visual scripting have narrowed the usability gap significantly.</p>
      <p>For developers building multiplayer or VR experiences, the choice is more nuanced than ever. New platforms like Godot and Bevy also introduce alternatives, forcing devs to consider long-term maintenance, publishing pipelines, and community support as critical factors.</p></div>`,
